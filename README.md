# Corewar

<h1>About :</h1><br/>

- The corewar is a game, a very special game. It consists in making small programs fight in a virtual machine.<br/>
- The goal of the game is to prevent other programs from functioning correctly, by any means necessary.<br/>
- The project will split in two main parts :<br/>
◦ The assembler : It will allow you to write programs destined to fight. It
will need to understand the assembly language, and generate binary programs
that can be interpreted by the virtual machine.<br/>
◦ The virtual machine : It will house the binary programs (the champions)
and provide them with a standard execution environment. It offers a lot of
features useful to the fight. It goes without saying that it has to be able to
run multiple programs simultaneously (or the fights will be really, really dull
...)<br/>
